## Epic 0 — Recent Additions (Location Dashboard & Core System Hub)

### Capability 0.0 — LGD Import Resilience & Location Search

- **Data Parsing**: Extended the Excel parser within the `user-service` to dynamically handle explicit LGD naming conventions (e.g., "District Name (In English)").
- **Admin Utilities**: Injected real-time multi-column search capabilities into the Marketplace Locations dashboard for Districts, Sub-Districts, and Villages.
- **Query Optimization**: Implemented `DISTINCT ON` rules to the District and Sub-District location queries within `locations.service.ts` to strictly safeguard the frontend against listing UI duplications.

### Capability 0.1 — Subscription Plan Versioning

- **Versioning Strategy**: Upgraded `SubscriptionPlan` to include an immutable `version` field.
- **Workflow**: Updates to pricing terms retire the active plan and insert a new `v+1` record.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Contractors retain their original pricing snapshot stored in `SubscriptionPaymentIntent` and their active historical plan logic.
- **UI Element**: "Log" buttons added to display a plan's version history in the admin panel.

### Capability 0.2 — Marketplace Hub Redesign & Pricing Integration

- **Guided Setup Flow**: Restructured the disconnected `/admin/marketplace` grid into a numbered flow: Locations → UOM → Categories → Services.
- **Operational Grid**: Separated daily items (SLA, Jobs, Contractors, Subs, Import Logs) into a lower secondary layout.
- **Integrated Pricing**: Merged `Pricing Configuration` into the `Service Creation Modal`. Creating or editing a service now simultaneously captures and executes mutations for Urban, Semi-Urban, and Rural pricing definitions.

### Capability 0.3 — RO Management & Rating Privacy

- **Validation Resilience**: Reinforced the `createRetailOutlet` flow with robust frontend error handling to capture and display database conflict exceptions (duplicate email/code).
- **Admin Productivity**: Executed a UI cleanup across the Consumers and Sites modules, stripping away non-functional export buttons and redundant action menus to minimize cognitive load.
- **Privacy-First Ratings**: Enhanced the `RatingSummary` query to dynamically aggregate and surface raw review comments while strictly sanitizing the data to remove all rater identifiers.

### Capability 0.5 — Cashfree Payment Lifecycle & Discovery Optimization

- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Transitioned from mock data to real-world payment orchestration via `CashfreeService`. Implemented official SDK integration for Order creation, Payment session management, and Refunds.
- **Asynchronous Settlement**: Instrumented a robust Webhook listener (`CashfreeWebhookController`) with HMAC security to bridge the gap between third-party payment success and internal system state (Subscription upgrades, Job settlements).
- **Discovery Safeguards**: Enhanced the `contractorMarketplaceProfile` schema and `searchContractors` logic to strictly enforce job quotas. Contractors are now automatically retired from search results once their PREMIUM tier limits are exhausted.
- **Data Integrity**: Hardened the contractor onboarding flow with proactive conflict validation (duplicate email/phone checks) and automated organizational hierarchy linking for RO-managed contractors.
- **Tiered Catalog Pricing**: Upgraded the `ServicesService` to fetch and return the complete Rural/Urban/Semi-Urban pricing matrix for the marketplace catalog in a single aliased database hit.

## Identified Bugs & Technical Debt

| ID      | Severity  | Area             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| BUG-001 | 🔴 High   | Billing          | `BillingResolver` is a complete placeholder — no queries or mutations implemented. `generateBillingExport`, `billingExports`, and `billingSummary` are listed as TODOs.                    |
| BUG-002 | 🟡 Medium | Auth             | `me` query throws generic `Error('User not found')` instead of using NestJS `NotFoundException` — will not be caught cleanly by global exception filter.                                   |
| BUG-003 | 🟡 Medium | Marketplace Jobs | Multiple resolvers (`createJob`, `acceptJob`, `rejectJob`, `generateOtp`, `verifyOtp`, `cancelJob`) throw raw `Error('Consumer/Contractor not found')` instead of typed NestJS exceptions. |
| BUG-004 | 🟡 Medium | Subscriptions    | `confirmPayment` fetches payment intent synchronously (`getPaymentIntent` is not `async`) but uses it in an `async` method — potential inconsistency if storage becomes async.             |
| BUG-005 | 🟢 Low    | Files            | `uploadBase64File` mutation is deprecated in favor of REST but still active — no deprecation enforcement at runtime.                                                                       |
| BUG-006 | 🟢 Low    | Consumers        | `ConsumersResolver` injects raw `db` for field resolvers (`circleName`, `divisionName`, `subdivisionName`) instead of using a dedicated hierarchy service — violates modular architecture. |
| BUG-007 | 🟢 Low    | Meter Readings   | `MeterReadingsResolver` directly injects and queries `db` for field resolvers instead of delegating to respective services — inconsistent with service-based architecture.                 |
| BUG-008 | 🟡 Medium | Payments         | Payment webhook endpoints are noted as REST but no REST controller implementation is visible in the payments module.                                                                       |
| BUG-009 | 🟢 Low    | Testing          | Only `app.controller.spec.ts` exists as a test file — no unit or E2E tests for any module resolver or service.                                                                             |
| BUG-010 | 🟡 Medium | Support          | `support` module has `imports.resolver.ts` (data imports) rather than a support/helpdesk resolver — module naming mismatch.                                                                |
